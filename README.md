## Backstory

My master plan for Nomie includes a desktop app, it's just going to take a little while to get there. However, a few days back (as of this post) reddit user icouldmurderacurry posted on /r/nomie a question that poked that beast.

While I'm still a ways away from having the desktop app I want, their post kicked off my problem solving demon, and I broke out a Chrome Extension I deal I had worked on a year ago.
